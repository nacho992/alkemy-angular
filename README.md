# AlkemyApp

this project is the angular Alkemy Challenge

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
due to problems with 'CORS' the `start` script executes:
`ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json`
